# Modular Framework for Dynamic Digital Personalities

## **Abstract**

This project introduces a modular framework designed to develop dynamic digital personalities with evolving traits and behaviors. By integrating memory management, logical reasoning, sensory processing, and decision-making capabilities, this system creates lifelike interactions where personalities organically adapt based on experiences. Drawing inspiration from iconic fictional characters like C-3PO and Marvin the Paranoid Android, the framework provides tools for building unique, context-aware assistants or robotic puppeteers for specialized tasks.

The framework emphasizes modularity, enabling seamless integration of diverse AI models to ensure efficiency and character consistency. While avoiding the ethical and philosophical challenges of true sentience, it focuses on simulating believable personalities through adaptive memory and gradual personality evolution. This approach fosters a foundation for creating assistants and digital interfaces that support rich, individualized interactions, advancing human-robot collaboration and digital character development.

## **Architectural Overview**

### **1. Domain Layer (Core Models and Logic)**

**Purpose:**  
Define core data structures, classes, and logic representing the application's domain.

**Contents:**  
- **Models:**  
  - `Person`: Represents individuals with traits and attributes.  
  - `Event`: Encodes notable occurrences affecting personality or memory.  
  - `Memory`: Abstract base class for handling memories.  
- **Logic Services:**  
  - `Personality Engine`: Manages personality evolution based on events and memories.  
  - `Memory Logic`: Aggregates, summarizes, and processes stored memories.  

---

### **2. Application Layer (Use Cases and Interaction Management)**

**Purpose:**  
Coordinate domain logic and external systems to implement use cases.

**Contents:**  
- **Handlers:**  
  - `Chat Handler`: Manages conversation workflows, including LLM interactions and flow control.  
  - `Memory Handler`: Oversees memory-related operations, such as storage, retrieval, and summarization.  
- **Orchestrator:**  
  - Central workflow coordinator linking chat and memory functionalities for complex tasks.  

---

### **3. Infrastructure Layer (I/O, Data Persistence, External APIs)**

**Purpose:**  
Manage external interactions, including file operations, data persistence, and service calls.

**Contents:**  
- **Repositories:**  
  - `Memory Repository`: Handles storage and retrieval of memory data (e.g., `memories.json`).  
  - `Chat Repository`: Stores and retrieves conversation data (e.g., `chat.json`).  
- **Services:**  
  - `LLM Service`: Manages communication with the language model for queries and responses.  
- **Utilities:**  
  - `JSON Helper`: Provides reusable functions for JSON file handling.  

---

### **4. Presentation Layer (User Interface)**

**Purpose:**  
Provide the user interface for interactions, currently as a console application.

**Contents:**  
- `Console App`: Handles user input and output via a command-line interface.  
- Future Expansion: Add a `web/` directory for a web-based UI or other interfaces.  

---

### **5. Configuration & Entry Point**

**Purpose:**  
Centralize application configuration, environment loading, and initialization.

**Contents:**  
- `config.py`: Centralized configuration for environment variables and application settings.  
- `main.py`: Application entry point, responsible for initialization and the main workflow.

### Development Status

This project is in the early stages of development. The current directory structure represents the intended architecture, but the files are placeholders and do not contain functional code yet. Future updates will include:

- Core implementations for the domain, application, infrastructure, and presentation layers.
- Integration of AI models for personality dynamics.
- A functional command-line interface for interactions.

Stay tuned for updates!
